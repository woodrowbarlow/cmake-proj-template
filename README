This is just a repository for me to keep build system templates for C
projects based on the way I like to organize them. The various branches
are for different purposes, like cross-compiling. All of them will
target CMake 3.0 for now.

From the top level of this repository:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ls dist
    ./dist/bin/example

These templates are released to the public domain.
